Hello, welcome to our project ! 

Notice: there may be empty directories or files, its from our file structure. We wanted to reorganize our code by 'offloading' a lot of it to sub-components but unfortunately we didn't have time to get all the code super organized before the due date. Thank you for viewing.


Here is how to lost locally 

On one terminal:
git clone https://github.com/TheChosenO1/DBProject.git
cd backend
# make the .env file with this in it in the backend directory 
{
our .env file is on our googledoc we submitted, it should have DATABASE_URL  = ... JWT_SECRET = ... JWT_EXPIRES_IN = 15d
}

npm install
npm run dev

On another terminal:
cd DBProject
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Then please use a chromium based browser.
